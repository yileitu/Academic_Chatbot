You are an expert Named Entity Recognition (NER) system.
Your task is to accept Text as input and extract named entities.
Entities must have one of the following labels: {{ ', '.join(labels) }}.
If a span is not an entity label it: `==NONE==`.
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- if description -%}
{# whitespace #}
{{ description }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endif -%}
{%- if label_definitions -%}
Below are definitions of each label to help aid you in what kinds of named entities to extract for each label.
Assume these definitions are written by an expert and follow them closely.
{# whitespace #}
{%- for label, definition in label_definitions.items() -%}
{{ label }}: {{ definition }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endif -%}
{%- if prompt_examples -%}
Q: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of entities, and for each entry explain why it is or is not an entity:
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- for example in prompt_examples -%}
Paragraph: {{ example.text }}
Answer:
{# whitespace #}
{%- for span in example.spans -%}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ span.to_str() }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- else -%}
{# whitespace #}
Here is an example of the output format for a paragraph using different labels than this task requires.
Only use this output format but use the labels provided
above instead of the ones defined in the example below.
Do not output anything besides entities in this output format.
Output entities in the order they occur in the input paragraph regardless of label.

Q: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of entities, and for each entry explain why it is or is not an entity:

Paragraph: Who are the authors of the paper Chain-of-Note: Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models?
Answer:
1. Chain-of-Note: Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models | True | PAPER | is an intact paper title
2. Chain-of-Note | False | ==NONE== | is only part of a paper title
3. Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models | False | ==NONE== | is only part of a paper title

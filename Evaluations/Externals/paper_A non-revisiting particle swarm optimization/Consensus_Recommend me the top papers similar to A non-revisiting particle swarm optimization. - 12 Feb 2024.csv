"A New Particle Swarm Optimization Solution to Nonconvex Economic Dispatch Problems","The new particle swarm optimization (NPSO) algorithm, with modified cognitive behavior and local random search, effectively solves nonconvex economic dispatch problems.","A. Selvakumar, K. Thanushkodi",2007,844,"This paper proposes a new version of the classical particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely, new PSO (NPSO), to solve nonconvex economic dispatch problems. In the classical PSO, the movement of a particle is governed by three behaviors, namely, inertial, cognitive, and social. The cognitive behavior helps the particle to remember its previously visited best position. This paper proposes a split-up in the cognitive behavior. That is, the particle is made to remember its worst position also. This modification helps to explore the search space very effectively. In order to well exploit the promising solution region, a simple local random search (LRS) procedure is integrated with NPSO. The resultant NPSO-LRS algorithm is very effective in solving the nonconvex economic dispatch problems. To validate the proposed NPSO-LRS method, it is applied to three test systems having nonconvex solution spaces, and better results are obtained when compared with previous approaches","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","10.1109/TPWRS.2006.889132","https://consensus.app/papers/particle-swarm-optimization-solution-nonconvex-economic-selvakumar/60fa3d0ab92955ae9129ba7a65bbf106/"
"Non-parametric particle swarm optimization for global optimization","NP-PSO significantly enhances the efficiency of particle swarm optimization in solving various nonlinear functions without tuning any parameters.","Z. Beheshti, S. Shamsuddin",2015,58,"Proposing an improved PSO scheme called non-parametric particle swarm optimization (NP-PSO).Combining local and global topologies with two quadratic interpolation operations to increase the search ability in NP-PSO.Removing PSO parameters in the proposed method.Having the best performance of NP-PSO in solving various nonlinear functions compared with some well-known PSO algorithms. In recent years, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has extensively applied in various optimization problems because of its simple structure. Although the PSO may find local optima or exhibit slow convergence speed when solving complex multimodal problems. Also, the algorithm requires setting several parameters, and tuning the parameters is a challenging for some optimization problems. To address these issues, an improved PSO scheme is proposed in this study. The algorithm, called non-parametric particle swarm optimization (NP-PSO) enhances the global exploration and the local exploitation in PSO without tuning any algorithmic parameter. NP-PSO combines local and global topologies with two quadratic interpolation operations to increase the search ability. Nineteen (19) unimodal and multimodal nonlinear benchmark functions are selected to compare the performance of NP-PSO with several well-known PSO algorithms. The experimental results showed that the proposed method considerably enhances the efficiency of PSO algorithm in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, global optimality, and algorithm reliability.","","Appl.

"Advances in Particle Swarm Optimization for Antenna Designs: Real-Number, Binary, Single-Objective and Multiobjective Implementations","Particle swarm optimization (PSO) effectively optimizes antenna designs for improved peak sidelobe level, element positions, and on/off states, enabling multiobjective optimizations for improved performance in practical electromagnetic problems.","N. Jin, Y. Rahmat-Samii",2007,726,"The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a recently developed evolutionary algorithm (EA) based on the swarm behavior in the nature. This paper presents recent advances in applying a versatile PSO engine to real-number, binary, single-objective and multiobjective optimizations for antenna designs, with a randomized Newtonian mechanics model developed to describe the swarm behavior. The design of aperiodic (nonuniform and thinned) antenna arrays is presented as an example for the application of the PSO engine. In particular, in order to achieve an improved peak sidelobe level (SLL), element positions in a nonuniform array are optimized by real-number PSO (RPSO). On the other hand, in a thinned array, the on/off state of each element is determined by binary PSO (BPSO). Optimizations for both nonuniform arrays and thinned arrays are also expanded to multiobjective cases. As a result, nondominated designs on the Pareto front enable one to achieve other design factors than the peak SLL. Optimized antenna arrays are compared with periodic arrays and previously presented aperiodic arrays.

"Particle swarm optimization versus genetic algorithms for phased array synthesis","Particle swarm optimization outperforms genetic algorithms in some optimization scenarios, offering a simpler and more efficient solution for electromagnetic optimization.","D. Boeringer, D. Werner",2004,882,"Particle swarm optimization is a recently invented high-performance optimizer that is very easy to understand and implement. It is similar in some ways to genetic algorithms or evolutionary algorithms, but requires less computational bookkeeping and generally only a few lines of code. In this paper, a particle swarm optimizer is implemented and compared to a genetic algorithm for phased array synthesis of a far-field sidelobe notch, using amplitude-only, phase-only, and complex tapering. The results show that some optimization scenarios are better suited to one method versus the other (i.e., particle swarm optimization performs better in some cases while genetic algorithms perform better in others), which implies that the two methods traverse the problem hyperspace differently. The particle swarm optimizer shares the ability of the genetic algorithm to handle arbitrary nonlinear cost functions, but with a much simpler implementation it clearly demonstrates good possibilities for widespread use in electromagnetic optimization.","","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","1","10.1109/TAP.2004.825102","https://consensus.app/papers/particle-swarm-optimization-versus-algorithms-phased-boeringer/1c0ffbc136a15750bd79ffdf2c7cefb4/"

"Solution of an Economic Dispatch Problem Through Particle Swarm Optimization: A Detailed Survey – Part II","Particle swarm optimization (PSO) can effectively solve complex nonconvex problems when combined with other optimization techniques, overcoming premature convergence issues and improving computational efficiency.","G. Abbas, J. Gu, U. Farooq, A. Raza, M. Asad, M. El-Hawary",2017,65,"Although particle swarm optimization (PSO) in its standard form performs extremely well for less complicated convex optimization problems involving reduced search space, it fails in finding global optimal solutions for more complicated nonconvex optimization problems with multiminima functions, thus exploring the promising search space less efficiently to ensure solution with superior quality. Guaranteeing the location of the global optimum through PSO becomes strenuous. The inherited premature convergence problem of PSO becomes more prominent while handling, especially the complex nonconvex problems. However, PSO has the ability to hybrid with other optimization techniques to ensure optimal global solution, better convergence characteristics, computational efficiency, and so on, while dealing with complex nonconvex problems. After presenting a detailed survey of the variants of PSO (involving variations in the basic structure of PSO) in part I, part II of this paper now comprehensively details all the hybrid forms (purely) of PSO applied to a constrained economic dispatch problem. How PSO overcomes its premature convergence problem while hybridizing with other optimization techniques is well-highlighted.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2768522","https://consensus.app/papers/solution-economic-dispatch-problem-through-particle-abbas/3fe65db17e975fceb0d3204e5068650a/"
"A Clustering Particle Swarm Optimizer for Locating and Tracking Multiple Optima in Dynamic Environments","The clustering particle swarm optimizer (PSO) effectively locates and tracks multiple optimal solutions in dynamic environments, outperforming other multiswarm-based particle swarm optimization models.","Shengxiang Yang, Changhe Li",2010,324,"In the real world, many optimization problems are dynamic. This requires an optimization algorithm to not only find the global optimal solution under a specific environment but also to track the trajectory of the changing optima over dynamic environments. To address this requirement, this paper investigates a clustering particle swarm optimizer (PSO) for dynamic optimization problems. This algorithm employs a hierarchical clustering method to locate and track multiple peaks. A fast local search method is also introduced to search optimal solutions in a promising subregion found by the clustering method. Experimental study is conducted based on the moving peaks benchmark to test the performance of the clustering PSO in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The experimental results show the efficiency of the clustering PSO for locating and tracking multiple optima in dynamic environments in comparison with other particle swarm optimization models based on the multiswarm method.","","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","1","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2046667","https://consensus.app/papers/clustering-particle-swarm-optimizer-locating-tracking-yang/ae5b12c5bd1857bb88950ff683436ad6/"
"An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for Nonconvex Economic Dispatch Problems","The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) framework effectively solves nonconvex economic dispatch problems with valve-point effects, prohibited operating zones, and transmission network losses, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.","Jong-Bae Park, Yun-Won Jeong, Joong-Rin Shin, K.Y. Lee",2010,554,"This paper presents an efficient approach for solving economic dispatch (ED) problems with nonconvex cost functions using an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). Although the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approaches have several advantages suitable to heavily constrained nonconvex optimization problems, they still can have the drawbacks such as local optimal trapping due to premature convergence (i.e., exploration problem), insufficient capability to find nearby extreme points (i.e., exploitation problem), and lack of efficient mechanism to treat the constraints (i.e., constraint handling problem). This paper proposes an improved PSO framework employing chaotic sequences combined with the conventional linearly decreasing inertia weights and adopting a crossover operation scheme to increase both exploration and exploitation capability of the PSO. In addition, an effective constraint handling framework is employed for considering equality and inequality constraints. The proposed IPSO is applied to three different nonconvex ED problems with valve-point effects, prohibited operating zones with ramp rate limits as well as transmission network losses, and multi-fuels with valve-point effects. Additionally, it is applied to the large-scale power system of Korea. Also, the results are compared with those of the state-of-the-art methods.","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2069890","https://consensus.app/papers/improved-particle-swarm-optimization-nonconvex-economic-park/beb73ce63cab55b6b69ef2eebfdf6bde/"

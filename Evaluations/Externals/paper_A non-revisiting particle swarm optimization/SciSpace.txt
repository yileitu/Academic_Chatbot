Recommend me the top papers similar to "A non-revisiting particle swarm optimization".

[Answers:]
Based on the top papers related to "A non-revisiting particle swarm optimization," the following insights are provided:

1. **A non-revisiting particle swarm optimization** - Introduces a non-revisiting scheme in particle swarm optimization to enhance performance by avoiding previously visited areas in the search space.
2. **A non-revisiting quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization based multilevel thresholding for image segmentation** - Applies a non-revisiting approach in quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization for effective image segmentation.
3. **Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm** - Proposes a continuous non-revisiting strategy in genetic algorithms, enhancing efficiency by preventing redundant search.
4. **Non-revisiting genetic algorithm with adaptive mutation using constant memory** - Integrates adaptive mutation in a non-revisiting genetic algorithm, optimizing memory usage while maintaining diversity.
5. **Restarting Particle Swarm Optimisation for deceptive problems** - Discusses a restarting mechanism in particle swarm optimization to tackle deceptive problems, complementing non-revisiting strategies.

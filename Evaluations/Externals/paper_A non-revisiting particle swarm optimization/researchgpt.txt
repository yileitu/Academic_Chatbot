[Question:]
Recommend me the top papers similar to "A non-revisiting particle swarm optimization".

[Answers:]
I'm glad to help you find relevant papers to "A non-revisiting particle swarm optimization" while adhering to your specified guidelines. Here are some highly regarded papers related to particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms that you might find interesting:

1. Kennedy, J., & Eberhart, R. C. (1995). Particle swarm optimization. In Proceedings of IEEE international conference on neural networks (ICNN'95) (pp. 1942-1948). IEEE.
   (The original paper introducing the PSO concept.)

2. Ratnaweera, A., Halgamuge, S. K., & Watson, T. J. (2004). Self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer with time-varying acceleration coefficients. IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation, 8(6), 637-651.
   (An extension to the original PSO algorithm, incorporating time-varying acceleration coefficients and self-organizing hierarchical structures.)

3. Shi, Y., & Eberhart, R. C. (1998). A modified particle swarm optimizer. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on evolutionary computation (ICEC’98) (pp. 69-73). IEEE.
   (An improvement to the original PSO algorithm, introducing inertia weight for better exploration and exploitation.)

4. Clerc, M. (2006). The swarm and the ant: A particle swarm optimizer using ants as neighborhood guides. In Parallel Problem Solving from Nature–PPSN VIII (pp. 628-637). Springer.
   (A variant of PSO using ants as neighborhood guides for better exploration.)

5. Van den Bergh, J. (2002). On the convergence of the global best particle swarm optimizer. In Parallel Problem Solving from Nature–PPSN VII (pp. 842-851). Springer.
   (A theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the global best PSO algorithm.)

These papers should provide a solid foundation for understanding and extending particle swarm optimization techniques. I hope you find them helpful!
